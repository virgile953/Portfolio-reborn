			"heading": "PingServer",
			"subheading": "Network monitoring WebApp for the Paris Air Show (React + Remix)",
			"description": "<strong>PingServer</strong> is a web application developed to provide real-time monitoring of the electrical status of network devices deployed at the <em>Salon International de l’Aéronautique et de l’Espace</em> (SIAE) in Le Bourget. Built with <strong>React</strong> and served via <strong>Remix</strong>, this WebApp allows the visualization, recording, and tracking of machines strategically placed upstream from UPS systems (IP phones, supervision PCs, etc.).\n\nThe project originated from a request by <strong>Mr. Hong QUACH</strong>, network architecture lead at the event, in response to frequent power outages affecting key areas such as entrance gates, reception desks, and administrative zones. Although these areas were backed by UPS systems, no immediate alerts were triggered during an outage, making it difficult to detect issues until users experienced a network disconnection.\n\nTo address this problem, we deployed <strong>IP phones</strong> — a cost-effective and widely available solution that automatically restarts — upstream from the UPS systems. Each phone is pinged every 20 seconds (configurable), allowing near real-time detection of active power outages.\n\nThe application is based on a simple and efficient architecture:\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Real-time interface</strong>: Instant display of each machine's status (online / offline), with a graph showing the last 8 pings and a live-updated response time chart.</li>\n  <li><strong>Automated alerts</strong>: A summary email is sent every 5 minutes to each registered user, listing the status of all monitored machines.</li>\n  <li><strong>Database-driven management</strong>:\n    <ul>\n      <li>Create, edit, or delete <strong>contacts</strong> (name, email)</li>\n      <li>Manage <strong>ping targets</strong> (IP address, name, location, ping frequency)</li>\n      <li>Access <strong>log history</strong>: timestamp, status, target machine, assigned contact, response time</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><strong>Integrated SQL console</strong>: A manual query interface for technical administrators (use with caution).</li>\n</ul>\n\nThe application was designed to be quickly deployable in critical environments. It uses a lightweight stack (<strong>Node.js 20</strong>, <strong>Bun</strong>, <strong>SQLite</strong>), supports optimized builds, and integrates with <strong>PM2</strong> for service-style automatic startup.\n\nThis project provided a practical, fast, and visual monitoring solution for the technical teams at the event, enhancing their ability to anticipate and respond to power issues across strategic network points."

		"Alert_acanthaster": {
			"heading": "Alert Acanthaster",
			"subheading": "Making of a website for a competition about sea life",
			"description": "The <strong>Alert Acanthaster</strong> website was created as part of a development class I conducted with a group of 7th-grade students. Together, we designed and built a lightweight, intuitive platform aimed at helping preserve marine life by addressing the threat of invasive Acanthaster species (crown-of-thorns starfish). The students actively participated in the project, contributing ideas, providing feedback, and learning about web development, while I handled the technical implementation.\n\nThe website is designed for ease of use, requiring no account creation for casual users. The landing page features a simple navbar with <em>\"Home\"</em>, <em>\"About\"</em>, <em>\"Login\"</em>, and <em>\"Register\"</em> options. The login and register functionalities are exclusively for researchers and professional divers who need access to detailed data for managing Acanthaster sightings. Authentication is handled using <strong>JWT</strong> stored in cookies for secure and seamless access.\n\nFor <strong>researchers</strong>, the platform offers advanced features:\n<ul>\n  <li>Customizable notifications: Researchers can set up alerts to be notified via email, push notifications, or both when a sighting is reported near their specified location (latitude and longitude).</li>  <li>Data management: A dedicated <em>\"Data\"</em> tab provides a comprehensive table of all reported sightings, with options to export data and update the status of sightings once they’ve been addressed.</li></ul>\nFor <strong>casual users</strong>, the focus is on simplicity and ease of use:\n<ul>\n  <li>Interactive map: Users can view a large map with markers indicating reported Acanthaster sightings. They can interact with the markers by giving a thumbs up or down to confirm the accuracy of the reports.</li>  <li>Reporting sightings: Users can easily report new sightings by clicking on the map, automatically capturing the location, and entering details such as the number of Acanthasters seen and their confidence level in the count.</li></ul>\nThe website’s standout feature is its clickable, interactive map, which was praised by an actual researcher for its practicality and ease of use—addressing a common challenge they faced with internal tools. Built with <strong>Next.js</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, and <strong>TypeScript</strong>, and backed by <strong>Postgres</strong> and <strong>NeonDB</strong>, the platform is both efficient and scalable, ensuring a smooth experience for all users.\n\nThis project not only delivered a practical tool for marine conservation but also provided the students with hands-on experience in software development, teamwork, and problem-solving."

			"description": "This project involved reworking the outdated website of a vintage and rare car collector/reseller. Originally built on a custom WordPress (Customify) theme, the site was non-responsive and difficult to manage, requiring the owner to rely on a friend for updates. I took it upon myself to redesign and rebuild the website from scratch, focusing on responsiveness, ease of use, and modern functionality.\n\nThe new version features:\n<ul>\n  <li>A custom login system with <strong>JWT authentication</strong> (stored in cookies) for secure access</li>  <li>A full <em>\"New Item\"</em> page, allowing the owner to easily add new cars with details such as title, description, model year, price, and photos</li>  <li>Automatic photo uploads to a <strong>Vercel blob store</strong> (similar to an S3 bucket), with URLs and display order saved in a <strong>Supabase</strong> database</li>  <li>An automatic status handler: The owner can mark cars as <em>available</em>, <em>sold</em>, or <em>reserved</em>, and they are displayed in their respective categories on the items page. Sold or reserved cars are highlighted with a ribbon indicating their status</li>  <li>A dedicated partner page for <strong>Secma cars</strong>, showcasing vehicles categorized as <em>new</em>, <em>used</em>, and <em>special prestations</em> (e.g., renting a car for a week or trackday events)</li></ul>\nBuilt with <strong>Next.js</strong> and <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>, the website is now fully responsive, optimized for mobile browsing, and significantly faster. The improved code structure and readability make it easier to maintain and scale, while the intuitive interface empowers the owner to manage content independently."

		"OptiXt_HR_auto": {
			"heading": "Automated HR File Processing Software",
			"subheading": "Streamlining HR data ingestion through automation",
			"description": "Historically, HR files containing all the data relative to each driver (names, address, date and place of birth, which car they drive, etc.) were manually integrated using existing interfaces that worked well but needed to be manually fed the file, checked, and the reporting was also generated by hand. This was fine but not scalable, and with each new client, the interface still had to be created, depending on their file format.\n\nThis project aimed to solve this problem, and the whole system of HR interface was re-created from the ground up, allowing:\n<ul>\n  <li>Creation of a new interface via configuration only (no need to update the SaaS software's code to add a new one)</li>  <li>Configuration of which column of data maps to which field in the database via a web interface (<strong>Angular/TypeScript</strong>)</li>  <li>Option to historize changes (e.g., if a driver moves from one entity to another, it creates a new history line reflecting the change)</li>  <li>Automatic scheduling of interfaces based on client agreements</li>  <li>Generation of an Excel report file with each modification made, based on old and new data</li></ul>\nThis allowed the team in charge of client data to focus their attention elsewhere, improved efficiency, and decreased human error. It also freed up a part of the dev team, removing them from the process of interface creation."
